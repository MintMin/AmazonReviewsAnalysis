       "      <th>My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had been using Innova Cat &amp; Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor &amp; Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor &amp; Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&amp;G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat &amp; Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat &amp; Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more \"crumbly\", i.e. there is a lot more \"food dust\" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat &amp; Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&amp;G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat &amp; Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called \"Simply Nourish\", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing \"Innova Cat &amp; Kitten\", or planning to buy it in the future, we believe P&amp;G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&amp;G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!</th>\n",

       "      <th>I have studied canine nutrition for the last 5 years and one of the biggest negatives I see in many commercial dog food companies is putting profit over care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In looking at ingredients in treats and food, many companies are fabulous. However, sadly, some put the cheapest ingredients that often even cause negative reactions in dogs into their products and then add flavors to make the dog want them so they continue to be bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, but don't take my word for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First ingredient in these? Rice Flour. Not meat. Not whole wheat flour. Not brown rice flour. Rice flour...bad carb, no protein, breaks down into sugar. But it gets better. Second main ingredient? SUGAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me repeat that. This contains mostly sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes they are shaped like bones and you feel like you are getting some good protein in and that they aren't like giving your pet hard candy. Naw. That's marketing. They only contain 7% protein and the protein source is derived from \"dried meat by product\". In other words, meat waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lets go back to sugar. You could give your dog a tablespoon of sugar each day and they would crave that too. But you will also have to pay for extra tartar scrapings from your vet which are stressful to your canine companion or have a pet lose their teeth in their later years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'm just getting started. 3rd ingredient? Wheat flour. Not whole wheat flour...processed and stripped of it's nutriotional value. Cheaper. And of no nutritional value. Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you think the fourth ingredient must be some protein huh? Naw, it's Propylene Glycol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then powdered cellulose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then sodium caseinate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but we dont want our dogs to thumb their paws up at such ingredients so natural poultry FLAVOR is then added. This is what some dog companies do, besides adding sugar, to make a product marketable...have it TASTE to the dog like it has something they need or want in it but it just be a flavoring. Then they beg for it and owners think it's great, buy more, and profit is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now then, let me sum this up with the warning under the feeding guide:&lt;br /&gt;\"Up to (meaning no more than) 5 sticks every week\"&lt;br /&gt;and \"not suitable for puppies or dogs under 5 lbs.\" Yet the jumbone mini with a yorkie on the front has these ingredients and then says not to give it to small dogs! That is called a legal disclaimer should your dog develop issues from the feeding of this product. What more needs to be said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, you don't have those warnings about nutritional harm when you just feed your dog some good natural treats or meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Animal crackers or saltwater taffy would offer your dog the same taste and ingredients for the most part as these and be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take it back. The above two wouldn't have as many artificial flavors and preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't buy into the hype \"big meaty center\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If by \"meaty\" they mean 'sugar and cellulse\" then I agree...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so hate seeing profit over care for companion animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I give it 1 star? I had no choice, but afterall, If you have to go by will your dog like it? You bet! But they like chocolate too...doesn't mean they should eat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not promoting any particular dog food or treat here...just giving my opinion (based on 5 years of study on the subject on my part) that you may wish to avoid sugar and cheap fillers for anything going into your pet. Animals are so little and dependant upon our choices for them. And, especially if you dont brush their teeth daily as most of us don't, giving them something filled with sugar and bad-carb flours is highly detrimental to thier livers, teeth, livers, kidneys, and full canine systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the artificial fillers and dried meat by products. Meat waste can have very bad things in it. It's not suitable for human consumption (these include the parts thrown away that may be diseased or tumerous. Yes, seriously, these ARE allowed to be used in dog food.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don't even consider the vitamins added. When made into a processed dog food of this type, they get baked out at such high temperatures used in the processing. So consider that teeninsy bit added at the very end of the ingredient list null and void after processing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy em a real soup bone or give them carrots or NATURAL wet dog food or cottage cheese for a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs don't do well on things like this and it can cost you more in their health than the savings on buying a less expensive brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love em (pets) too much not to review this honestly...</th>\n",
