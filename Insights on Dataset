Michael's Week1&2 ProductID Analysis

Conclusion 1: Data from ***1999 to 2002*** is not significant enough to impact overall model (e.g. 1999 total reviews are only 5, 
all scoring their products 5 stars). 

Conclusion 2: Scores don't appear to fluctuate based on ***month*** compared to overall scores. 
The hypothesis was that with shopping seasons (e.g. Xmas in December, Black Friday in November, etc.) 
there would be an uptick in variance as uncommon or newcoming consumers purchase items they don't typically purchase, 
and therefore the spread of Scores would be larger compared to the average std. However, 
the standard deviation deviates a mere +0.05 from overall standard deviation in December (the largest std).
Strangely enough, November (e.g. Thanksgiving, Black Friday) appear to deviate less than overall standard deviation by -0.03. 
While not a strong measure of variation, it possibly warrants further investigation as it suggests data for November from 1999 
to 2012 is more uniform compared to data overall.We can also try a lineplot for standard deviation based on year AND month 
to see if over time standard deviation changes as Amazon becomes an internet phenomena
